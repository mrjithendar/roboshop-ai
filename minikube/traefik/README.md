# Traefik and public ingress on Vultr

The `ingressclass "traefik" not found` error means the controller has not been installed. cert-manager issues certificates; it does not install an ingress controller.

## Complete setup on Vultr

Run these commands **on your Vultr server**, from the repository root, after updating your checkout with these files:

```bash
bash minikube/deploy-traefik.sh
bash minikube/expose-ingress.sh
bash minikube/deploy-cert-manager.sh
bash minikube/deploy-grafana.sh
```

Then open **https://jithendar.com/grafana/**. DNS must point to Vultr, and the Vultr firewall must allow inbound TCP **80 and 443**. Keep port 80 available for Let's Encrypt renewal. Existing listeners on those ports must be reconciled before running the host proxy; the script does not stop unrelated services or delete clusters.

`deploy-traefik.sh` installs the official pinned Traefik Helm chart 42.0.0 into namespace `traefik`. It creates IngressClass `traefik` without making it the cluster default, exposes HTTP NodePort 30080 and HTTPS NodePort 30443, and waits for readiness. Requires Kubernetes 1.30+ (the existing Minikube setup uses 1.37). The Traefik dashboard is not publicly exposed.

`expose-ingress.sh` must run on the **Linux Docker host**, with local Docker and kubectl access. It follows the installer's selected Minikube profile and starts a small HAProxy Docker container to forward host 80/443 to the Minikube node's 30080/30443. This supplies the missing route through Docker's private network without recreating Minikube. TLS terminates in Traefik; HAProxy holds no certificates. TCP forwarding also supports Grafana WebSockets.

The proxy restarts with Docker. Rerun the host script after replacing the Minikube profile. An existing proxy on a different Docker network is left intact with instructions, rather than silently replaced. The configuration is stored under `~/.minikube/robotshop-installer/ingress-edge/`. Removing the Minikube cluster does not automatically remove this host proxy.

## From your Mac

The Helm scripts work through your remote kubeconfig. The host routing script does **not** run on your Mac.

```bash
# Mac: select the context imported by kubeconfig.sh.
kubectl config get-contexts
KUBE_CONTEXT=mk4 bash minikube/deploy-traefik.sh

# SSH to Vultr, enter your repository, and run there:
bash minikube/expose-ingress.sh

# Mac: after host routing is ready, use the same context:
KUBE_CONTEXT=mk4 bash minikube/deploy-cert-manager.sh
KUBE_CONTEXT=mk4 bash minikube/deploy-grafana.sh
```

Replace `mk4` with the actual context if different. On the host, `PROFILE=...` selects a different base profile; its saved selected-profile mapping is followed automatically. No SSH passwords are stored or passed to scripts.

## Verify and troubleshoot

Use `--context=YOUR_CONTEXT` with kubectl if necessary:

```bash
kubectl -n traefik get pods,svc
kubectl get ingressclass traefik
kubectl -n traefik logs deployment/traefik --tail=100
# On Vultr:
docker logs robotshop-ingress-edge-$(id -u) --tail=100
ss -ltnp '( sport = :80 or sport = :443 )'
# From either host:
curl -I http://jithendar.com/
curl -I https://jithendar.com/grafana/login
```

An HTTP 404 before deploying routes is normal: it shows Traefik is reachable. HTTPS must have a ready certificate before browsers trust it. A timeout means DNS/firewall/host forwarding still needs attention. If the host firewall blocks traffic to the Docker bridge, inspect its forwarding rules rather than disabling the firewall globally.

If the proxy failed because a port was occupied, resolve that conflict and remove only the failed proxy before rerunning:

```bash
# Stops this site's host ingress; use only when replacing/removing this proxy.
docker rm -f robotshop-ingress-edge-$(id -u)
bash minikube/expose-ingress.sh
```
